Welcome to the Introduction to the AWS Code Family workshop!

In this workshop we will explore the AWS DevOps tooling to build and deploy a simple Java web application.

We will use AWS CodeCommit as a Git repository to store our code and AWS CodeArtifact to manage software packages. We will use AWS CodeBuild to compile the Java application, and AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the application to an EC2 web server. AWS CodePipeline will help orchestrate the whole process.

During this workshop we will be deploying a local customised version of the popular Unicorn Rentals application Wild Rydes.
