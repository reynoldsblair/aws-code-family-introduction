Congratulations. you have completed the Introduction to AWS Code Family workshop! 

You've explored how to use AWS CodeCommit as a Git repository and AWS CodeArtifact as a build artifact repository. You've set up a build process using AWS CodeBuild and how to manage deployments using AWS CodeDeploy. You've learned how to put these services together into a fully managed CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline. Additionally, you've explored how to perform container builds and upload them to Amazon ECR, and how to deploy a serverless application using AWS SAM.
